# Traction Formula Engineering

Traction Formula Engineering is a Auto Racing and Engineering Firm (lol)

We are on the way to becoming a first rate Formula 1, Formula E, or maybe Extreme E
race team. 

We are currently in the beginning stage.  Like, /way/ beginning stage. Like we are 
one guy duct taping raspberry pi's to remote control cars stage. Well, we would be
if we could currently afford an RC car.

But we persist!  And will one day be up there with the likes of Honda, Maclaren and Ferrari!
Or we will just have a shit ton of fun fucking around with shit on Twitch, and breaking
stuff.

Feel free to join the adventure, with pull requests or come on down to:
